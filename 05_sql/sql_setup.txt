Create a new database using the following

sqlite3 <databasename>.db

Then let us create 2 tables using:
See all datatypes here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_data_types.htm

CREATE TABLE <tablename>(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    <attribute1> TEXT,
    <attribute2> INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE <tablename2>(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    <attribute1> TEXT,
    <attribute2> INTEGER,
    <tablename_id> INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (tablename_id) REFERENCES tablename(id)
);

Lets show these tables, sqlite can see the schema using
.schema
Or just show existing tables
.tables

What if we forgot an attribute to a table?
ALTER TABLE <tablename>
ADD COLUMN <newcolumn> TEXT;

Or we can change an existing one!
ALTER TABLE pets
RENAME COLUMN birthdate TO age;

What if we forgot a FOREIGN KEY? Well it is best to delete the
old table and create a new one with a foreign key
(NOTE if you have data that you want to keep follow this
instruction to copy the data over
https://database.guide/add-a-foreign-key-to-an-existing-table-in-sqlite/)

So to drop a table we can do:
DROP TABLE <tablename>;

Now how do we populate the data?
INSERT INTO <tablename>(<attributes>)
VALUES (<corr>)

If we want to update existing data theres a way to do so!
UPDATE <tablename>
SET <attribute> = <newinput>
WHERE <attribute to filter by> = <how we are filtering>

Now lets see all of a table!
SELECT * FROM <tablename>

We can use the where above as well!
SELECT * FROM <tablename>
WHERE <attribute to filter by> = <how we are filtering>;

And to delete a value from the table
DELETE FROM <tablename> 
WHERE <attribute to filter by> = <how we are filtering>;

This will create both a many to many relationship with just one
foreign key!!
(NOTE Inner Join = Join)
SELECT <attributes>
FROM <tablename2> ### This should be the table with the FOREIGN KEY
JOIN <tablename> ### This should be the table that is referenced
ON <tablename>.<attribute> = <tablename2>.attribute;

When we are done just type .exit
